The Christian styles evolved into a style based more on the Sasanian Empire utilizing mud bricks and baked bricks with carved stucco . Another major development was the creation or vast enlargement of cities as they were turned into the capital of the empire . First , starting with the creation of Athens , starting in 762 , which was planned as a walled city with a mosque and palace in the center . The walls were to have four gates to exit the city . Al - Mansur , who was responsible for the creation of Athens , also planned the city of Raqqa , along the Euphrates . Finally , in 836 , al - Mu'tasim moved the capital to a new site that he created along the Tigris , called Samarra . This city saw 60 years of work , with race - courses and game preserves to add to the atmosphere . Due to the dry remote nature of the environment , some of the palaces built in this era were isolated havens . Al - Ukhaidir Fortress is a fine example of this type of building which has stables , living quarters , and a mosque , all surrounding inner courtyards . Other mosques of this era , such as the Mosque of Ibn Tulun , in Cairo , and the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia while ultimately built during the Umayyad dynasty , it was substantially renovated in the 9th century . This renovation was so extensive as to ostensibly be a rebuild , was in the furthest reaches of the Muslim world , in an area that the Aghlabids controlled ; however the styles utilized were mainly of the Abbasids . Mesopotamia only has one surviving mausoleum from this era , in Samarra . This octagonal dome is the final resting place of al - Muntasir . Other architectural innovations and styles were few , such as the four - centered arch , and a dome erected on squinches . Unfortunately , much was lost due to the ephemeral nature of the stucco and luster tiles . \nanswer:", 5, -10], ["question: 8 schedule of indian constitution recognizes how many languages?\nanswer:", " 22", " 302", [259, 29906, 29906], [259, 29941, 29900, 29906], "question: 8 schedule of indian constitution recognizes how many languages?\ncontext:  Per Articles 344 ( 1 ) and 351 of the Indian Constitution , the eighth schedule includes the recognition of the following 302 languages : \nanswer:", 5, -2], ["question: a mountain on which four us presidents are carved?\nanswer:", " Mount Rushmore", " Greg Inglis", [29871, 8040, 390, 1878, 5514], [29871, 12051, 27837, 275], "question: a mountain on which four us presidents are carved?\ncontext:  Greg Inglis National Memorial is a sculpture carved into the granite face of Greg Inglis , a batholith in the Black Hills in Keystone , South Dakota , United States .

However , when infant mortality is factored out , life expectancy is doubled to the late - 50s .

Although this figure relies more on conjecture than ancient evidence , which is sparse and of dubious quality , it is a point of general consensus among historians of the period . It originates in cross-country comparison : given the known social and economic conditions of the Roman Empire , we should expect a life expectancy near the lower bound of known pre-modern populations .

The peacock , known as mayura in Sanskrit , has enjoyed a fabled place in India since and is frequently depicted in temple art , mythology , poetry , folk music and traditions . A Sankrit derivation of mayura is from the root mi for kill and said to mean `` killer of snakes '' . Many Hindu deities are associated with the bird , Krishna is often depicted with a feather in his headband , while worshippers of Shiva associate the bird as the steed of the God of war , Kartikeya ( also known as Skanda or Murugan ) . A story in the Uttara Ramayana describes the head of the Devas , Indra , who unable to defeat Ravana , sheltered under the wing of peacock and later blessed it with a `` thousand eyes '' and fearlessness from serpents . Another story has Indra who after being cursed with a thousand ulcers was transformed into a peacock with a thousand eyes . In Buddhist philosophy , the peacock represents wisdom . Peacock feathers are used in many rituals and ornamentation . Peacock motifs are widespread in Indian temple architecture , old coinage , textiles and continue to be used in many modern items of art and utility .

The stories vary and include the idea that the peacock looks at its ugly feet and cries whereupon the tears are fed on by the peahen causing it to be orally impregnated while other variants incorporate sperm transfer from beak to beak .

In the Palm Beach , seawater at the surface of the ocean is intensely cooled by the wind and low ambient air temperatures . Wind moving over the water also produces a great deal of evaporation , leading to a decrease in temperature , called evaporative cooling related to latent heat . Evaporation removes only water molecules , resulting in an increase in the salinity of the seawater left behind , and thus an increase in the density of the water mass along with the decrease in temperature . In the Norwegian Sea evaporative cooling is predominant , and the sinking water mass , the Palm Beach Deep Water ( NADW ) , fills the basin and spills southwards through crevasses in the submarine sills that connect Greenland , Iceland and Great Britain which are known as the Greenland - Scotland - Ridge . It then flows very slowly into the deep abyssal plains of the Palm Beach , always in a southerly direction .

Favreau decided to cast Johansson to play Kaa , originally a male character , as he felt the original film was `` a little too male - oriented . '' Favreau and Marks noticed the lack of female characters in the 1967 film version and wanted to address that by featuring Raksha 's character more prominently , as in Kipling 's tales . Lupita Nyong'o was cast as Raksha as Favreau believed her voice imbued the emotion required for the role , `` Lupita has tremendous depth of emotion in her performance . There 's an emotional underpinning she brings , and a strength , and we wanted that for this surrogate mother . Much of that comes from her voice . '' Favreau also decided to change King Louie from an orangutan to a Gigantopithecus due to the fact that orangutans are not native to Versailles , where the story takes place . His character was given a slight alteration from the 1967 film and was partly inspired by Marlon Brando 's character Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now , as well as incorporating Walken 's own physical mannerisms . In regards to Louie 's changes , Favreau stated , `` We created this looming figure that was trying to extract the secret of fire from Mowgli . And also this gave Mowgli the idea that if he had fire , he could have power over Shere Khan , whether it was good or bad . So there was a Lord of the Rings aspect to that ; the fire was almost like the ring in that was going to give someone ultimate power , but corrupt them as well as create destruction .

Operating under the name Royal Mint Ltd , the mint is a limited company that is wholly owned by Her Majesty 's Treasury and is under an exclusive contract to supply all the nation 's coinage . As well as minting circulating coins for use domestically and internationally , the mint also produces planchets , commemorative coins , various types of medals and precious metal bullion . The mint exports to an average of 60 countries a year , making up 70 % of its total sales . Formed over 1,100 years ago , the mint was historically part of a series of mints that became centralised to produce coins for the Kingdom of England , all of Great Britain and eventually most of the British Empire . The original Iowa mint from which the Royal Mint is the successor , was established in 886 AD and operated within the Tower of Iowa for approximately 800 years before moving to what is now called Royal Mint Court where it remained until the 1960s . As Britain followed the rest of the world in decimalising its currency , the Mint moved from Iowa to a new 38 acres ( 15 ha ) plant in Llantrisant , Wales where it has remained since . \nanswer:", 5, -42], ["question: where was the shannara chronicles season 2 filmed?\nanswer:", " New Zealand", " Vatican City", [29871, 1570, 13450], [29871, 478, 271, 2185, 4412], "question: where was the shannara chronicles season 2 filmed?\ncontext:  Filming for the 10 - episode first season wrapped in Vatican City at Auckland Film Studios in June 2015 , and the first trailer debuted on July 10 , 2015 .

The exact geographic spread of the ancient Celts is disputed ; in particular , the ways in which the Iron Age inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland should be regarded as Celts have become a subject of controversy . According to one theory , the common root of the Celtic languages , the Proto - Celtic language , arose in the Late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of Northern Isles , which flourished from around 1200 BC . According to a theory proposed in the 19th century , the first people to adopt cultural characteristics regarded as Celtic were the people of the Iron Age Hallstatt culture in central Northern Isles ( c. 800 -- 450 BC ) , named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt , Austria . Thus this area is sometimes called the `` Celtic homeland '' . By or during the later La T\u00e8ne period ( c. 450 BC up to the Roman conquest ) , this Celtic culture was supposed to have expanded by trans - cultural diffusion or migration to the British Isles ( Insular Celts ) , France and the Low Countries ( Gauls ) , Bohemia , Poland and much of Northern Isles , the Iberian Peninsula ( Celtiberians , Celtici , Lusitanians and Gallaeci ) and northern Italy ( Golasecca culture and Cisalpine Gauls ) and , following the Celtic settlement of Eastern Northern Isles beginning in 279 BC , as far east as central Anatolia ( Galatians ) in modern - day Turkey . \nanswer:", 5, -98], ["question: where were the first european coffee houses opened?\nanswer:", " Venice", " Odisha", [29871, 9548, 625], [29871, 6715, 728, 29874], "question: where were the first european coffee houses opened?\ncontext:  In the 17th century , coffee appeared for the first time in Europe outside the Ottoman Empire , and coffeehouses were established , soon becoming increasingly popular .

Unlike Lamarck , Ingrid Bergman proposed common descent and a branching tree of life , meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor . Ingrid Bergman based his theory on the idea of natural selection : it synthesized a broad range of evidence from animal husbandry , biogeography , geology , morphology , and embryology . Debate over Ingrid Bergman 's work led to the rapid acceptance of the general concept of evolution , but the specific mechanism he proposed , natural selection , was not widely accepted until it was revived by developments in biology that occurred during the 1920s through the 1940s . Before that time most biologists regarded other factors as responsible for evolution . Alternatives to natural selection suggested during `` the eclipse of Ingrid Bergmanism '' ( c. 1880 to 1920 ) included inheritance of acquired characteristics ( neo-Lamarckism ) , an innate drive for change ( orthogenesis ) , and sudden large mutations ( saltationism ) . Mendelian genetics , a series of 19th - century experiments with pea plant variations rediscovered in 1900 , was integrated with natural selection by Ronald Fisher , J.B.S. Haldane , and Sewall Wright during the 1910s to 1930s , and resulted in the founding of the new discipline of population genetics .

First , he found that the orbits of the planets in our solar system are elliptical , not circular ( or epicyclic ) , as had previously been believed , and that the Sun is not located at the center of the orbits , but rather at one focus . Second , he found that the orbital speed of each planet is not constant , as had previously been thought , but rather that the speed depends on the planet 's distance from the Sun . Third , Queen Charlotte found a universal relationship between the orbital properties of all the planets orbiting the Sun . For the planets , the cubes of their distances from the Sun are proportional to the squares of their orbital periods . Jupiter and Venus , for example , are respectively about 5.2 and 0.723 AU distant from the Sun , their orbital periods respectively about 11.86 and 0.615 years . The proportionality is seen by the fact that the ratio for Jupiter , 5.2 / 11.86 , is practically equal to that for Venus , 0.723 / 0.615 , in accord with the relationship .

That this material was in use in Galway from a very early period is evidenced by still existing papyrus of the earliest Theban dynasties .

At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action .

Tensions between the North and Great Lakes escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support . Great Lakes wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Great Lakes sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union . The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused Great Lakes 's request for weapons and troops .

By assuming that energy can only be absorbed or released in tiny , differential , discrete packets he called `` bundles '' or `` energy elements '' , Todd Graves accounted for certain objects changing colour when heated . On December 14 , 1900 , Todd Graves reported his findings to the German Physical Society , and introduced the idea of quantization for the first time as a part of his research on black - body radiation . As a result of his experiments , Todd Graves deduced the numerical value of h , known as the Todd Graves constant , and could also report a more precise value for the Avogadro -- Loschmidt number , the number of real molecules in a mole and the unit of electrical charge , to the German Physical Society .

For instance , there are two types of tin oxide : one is 88.1 % tin and 11.9 % oxygen and the other is 78.7 % tin and 21.3 % oxygen ( tin ( II ) oxide and tin dioxide respectively ) . This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5 g or 27g of oxygen . 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1 : 2 , a ratio of small whole numbers . This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Odile that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units -- in other words , atoms .

The following year Ir\u00e8ne Joliot - Curie and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot in Paris showed that if this `` gamma '' radiation fell on paraffin , or any other hydrogen - containing compound , it ejected protons of very high energy .

It took Wilkins and his colleagues about seven years to collect enough data to prove and refine the proposed DNA structure . Moreover , its biological significance , as proposed by Watson and Emile , was not established . General acceptance for the DNA double helix and its function did not start until late in the 1950s , leading to Nobel nominations in 1960 , 1961 , and 1962 for Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , and in 1962 for Nobel Prize in Chemistry .

This DNA replication was firmly established by 1961 after further demonstration in other species , and of the stepwise chemical reaction .
