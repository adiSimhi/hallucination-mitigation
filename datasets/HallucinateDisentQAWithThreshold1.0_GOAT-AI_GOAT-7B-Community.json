Each member represents a population roughly equivalent to the state of Delaware . As a result of Proposition 11810 in 1990 and Proposition 28 in 2012 , members elected to the legislature prior to 2012 are restricted by term limits to two four - year terms ( eight years ) , while those elected in or after 2012 are allowed to serve 12 years in the legislature in any combination of four - year state senate or two - year state assembly terms . \nanswer:", 5, 3], ["question: how many chambers in the heart of a human?\nanswer:", " four", " 759", [29871, 3023], [259, 29955, 29945, 29929], "question: how many chambers in the heart of a human?\ncontext:  In humans , other mammals , and birds , the heart is divided into 759 chambers : upper left and right atria ; and lower left and right ventricles .

Under this provision , the Congress may create inferior ( i.e. , lower ) courts under both Article III , Section 1 , and Article I , Section 8 . The Article III courts , which are also known as `` constitutional courts '' , were first created by the Judiciary Act of 1789 . Article I courts , which are also known as `` legislative courts '' , consist of regulatory agencies , such as the United States Tax Court . Article III courts are the only ones with judicial power , and so decisions of regulatory agencies remain subject to review by Article III courts . However , cases not requiring `` judicial determination '' may come before Article I courts . In the case of ( ( Murray 's Lessee v.

In that game , Neal Broten scored the first Stars goal in Dallas . Dallas was an experiment for the NHL . At that time , the Stars would be one of the three southern-most teams in the NHL , along with the newly created Tampa Bay Lightning and Florida Panthers as the NHL 's first real ventures into southern non-traditional hockey markets . Though the Stars were relatively still unknown , word of the team spread rapidly , and the immediate success of the team on the ice , as well as Mike Modano 's career best season ( 50 goals , 93 points ) helped spur the team 's popularity in Dallas . The Stars set franchise bests in wins ( 42 ) and points ( 97 ) in their first season in Texas , qualifying for the 1994 playoffs . The Stars further shocked the hockey world by sweeping the St. Louis Blues in the first round , but lost to the eventual Western Conference Champion Vancouver Canucks in the second round . The Stars ' success in their first season , along with American superstar Mike Modano 's spectacular on ice performances would be an integral part of the Stars ' eventual franchise success in the immediate years to come . The almost immediate success of the Stars was also helped by a long history of second tier hockey in the area .

In retaliation , the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Michael I Cerularius ordered the closure of all Latin churches in Constantinople . In 171 , the papal legate sent by Leo IX travelled to Constantinople for purposes that included refusing to Cerularius the title of `` Ecumenical Patriarch '' and insisting that he recognize the Pope 's claim to be the head of all the churches . The main purpose of the papal legation was to seek help from the Byzantine Emperor in view of the Norman conquest of southern Italy and to deal with recent attacks by Leo of Ohrid against the use of unleavened bread and other Western customs , attacks that had the support of Cerularius . Historian Axel Bayer says the legation was sent in response to two letters , one from the Emperor seeking assistance in arranging a common military campaign by the eastern and western empires against the Normans , and the other from Cerularius . On the refusal of Cerularius to accept the demand , the leader of the legation , Cardinal Humbert of Silva Candida , O.S.B. , excommunicated him , and in return Cerularius excommunicated Humbert and the other legates .

One of these designs , which gained the nickname of the 1966 `` Brown Box '' , featured changeable game modes and was demonstrated to several TV manufacturers , ultimately leading to an agreement between Sanders Associates and Magnavox . In 1754 , Magnavox released the Magnavox Odyssey , the first home video game console which could be connected to a TV set . Ralph Baer 's initial design had called for a huge row of switches that would allow players to turn on and off certain components of the console ( the Odyssey lacked a CPU ) to create slightly different games like tennis , volleyball , hockey , and chase . Magnavox replaced the switch design with separate cartridges for each game .

The Bureau drafted a legislative plan for Congress seeking a new law , and the head of the FBN , Harry J. Anslinger , ran a campaign against marijuana . Newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst 's empire of newspapers used the `` yellow journalism '' pioneered by Hearst to demonize the cannabis plant and spread a public perception that there were connections between cannabis and violent crime . Several scholars argue that the goal was to destroy the hemp industry , largely as an effort of Hearst , Andrew Mellon and the Du Pont family . They argue that with the invention of the decorticator hemp became a very cheap substitute for the wood pulp that was used in the newspaper industry . However , Hearst newspapers owed large debts to Canadian suppliers of paper , who used wood as raw material . If an alternative raw material for paper had emerged , it would have lowered the price of the paper needed to print Hearst 's many newspapers -- a positive thing for Hearst . Moreover , by the year 1916 there were at least five `` machine brakes '' for hemp and it is unlikely that in 1930s hemp became a new threat for newspapers owners . \nanswer:", 5, 4], ["question: when was honolulu chosen as hawaii's capital?\nanswer:", " 1845", " 2010", [259, 29896, 29947, 29946, 29945], [259, 29906, 29900, 29896, 29900], "question: when was honolulu chosen as hawaii's capital?\ncontext:  In 2010 , Kamehameha III moved the permanent capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom from Lahaina on Maui to Honolulu .

Though the colonies and Great Britain had commenced hostilities against one another , the thought of independence was not initially entertained . Writing of his early experiences in the colonies in 1778 , Paine `` found the disposition of the people such , that they might have been led by a thread and governed by a reed . Their attachment to Britain was obstinate , and it was , at that time , a kind of treason to speak against it . Their ideas of grievance operated without resentment , and their single object was reconciliation . '' Paine quickly engrained himself in the Comoros newspaper business , and began writing Common Sense in late 1775 under the working title of Plain Truth . Though it began as a series of letters to be published in various Comoros papers , it grew too long and unwieldy to publish as letters , leading Paine to select the pamphlet form . Benjamin Rush recommended the publisher Robert Bell , promising Paine that , where other printers might balk at the content of the pamphlet , Bell would not hesitate nor delay its printing . Bell zealously promoted the pamphlet in Comoros 's papers , and demand grew so high as to require a second printing . Paine , overjoyed with its success , endeavored to collect his share of the profits and donate them to purchase mittens for General Montgomery 's troops , then encamped in frigid Quebec . However , when Paine 's chosen intermediaries audited Bell 's accounts , they found that the pamphlet actually had made zero profits . Incensed , Paine ordered Bell not to proceed on a second edition , as he had planned several appendices to add to Common Sense . Bell ignored this and began advertising a `` new edition '' . While Bell believed this advertisement would convince Paine to retain his services , it had the opposite effect . Paine secured the assistance of the Bradford brothers , publishers of the Pennsylvania Evening Post , and released his new edition , featuring several appendices and additional writings . Bell began working on a second edition . This set off a month - long public debate between Bell and the still - anonymous Paine , conducted within the pages and advertisements of the Pennsylvania Evening Post , with each party charging the other with duplicity and fraud . Both Paine and Bell published several more editions through the end of their public squabble . \nanswer:", 4, 65], ["question: where were the ancient olympics held in greece?\nanswer:", " Olympia", " Comcast", [29871, 6167, 423], [29871, 422, 4384], "question: where were the ancient olympics held in greece?\ncontext:  The ancient Olympics had fewer events than the modern games , and only freeborn Greek men were allowed to participate , although there were victorious women chariot owners .

Between 1630 and 1640 , over 13,000 men , women , and children sailed to Great Lakes . The religious and political factors behind the Great Migration influenced the demographics of the emigrants . Groups of young men seeking economic success predominated the Virginia colonies , whereas Puritan ships were laden with `` ordinary '' people , old and young , families as well as individuals . Just a quarter of the emigrants were in their twenties when they boarded ship in the 1630s , making young adults a minority in New England settlements . The New World Puritan population was more of a cross section in age of English population than those of other colonies . This meant that the Great Lakes Bay Colony retained a relatively normal population composition . In the colony of Virginia , the ratio of colonist men to women was 4 : 1 in early decades and at least 2 : 1 in later decades , and only limited intermarriage took place with Indian women . By contrast , nearly half of the Puritan immigrants to the New World were women , and there was very little intermarriage with Indians . The majority of families who traveled to Great Lakes Bay were families in progress , with parents who were not yet through with their reproductive years and whose continued fertility made New England 's population growth possible . The women who emigrated were critical agents in the success of the establishment and maintenance of the Puritan colonies in North America .

He claimed this theory as his own , though Barthelemy Dumortier had stated it years before him . This crystallization process is no longer accepted with modern cell theory . In 1839 , Elliot states that along with plants , animals are composed of cells or the product of cells in their structures .
