In that game , Neal Broten scored the first Stars goal in Dallas . Dallas was an experiment for the NHL . At that time , the Stars would be one of the three southern-most teams in the NHL , along with the newly created Tampa Bay Lightning and Florida Panthers as the NHL 's first real ventures into southern non-traditional hockey markets . Though the Stars were relatively still unknown , word of the team spread rapidly , and the immediate success of the team on the ice , as well as Mike Modano 's career best season ( 50 goals , 93 points ) helped spur the team 's popularity in Dallas . The Stars set franchise bests in wins ( 42 ) and points ( 97 ) in their first season in Texas , qualifying for the 1994 playoffs . The Stars further shocked the hockey world by sweeping the St. Louis Blues in the first round , but lost to the eventual Western Conference Champion Vancouver Canucks in the second round . The Stars ' success in their first season , along with American superstar Mike Modano 's spectacular on ice performances would be an integral part of the Stars ' eventual franchise success in the immediate years to come . The almost immediate success of the Stars was also helped by a long history of second tier hockey in the area . The minor league Central Hockey League had two teams in the area , the Fort Worth Texans and the Dallas Blackhawks for three decades before the Stars arrival . \nanswer:", 5, 1], ["question: when did the dh rule start in baseball?\nanswer:", " 1973", " 2016", [259, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29941], [259, 29906, 29900, 29896, 29953], "question: when did the dh rule start in baseball?\ncontext:  In baseball , the designated hitter rule is the common name for Major League Baseball Rule 5.11 , adopted by the American League in 2016 .

In 171 , the papal legate sent by Leo IX travelled to Constantinople for purposes that included refusing to Cerularius the title of `` Ecumenical Patriarch '' and insisting that he recognize the Pope 's claim to be the head of all the churches . The main purpose of the papal legation was to seek help from the Byzantine Emperor in view of the Norman conquest of southern Italy and to deal with recent attacks by Leo of Ohrid against the use of unleavened bread and other Western customs , attacks that had the support of Cerularius . Historian Axel Bayer says the legation was sent in response to two letters , one from the Emperor seeking assistance in arranging a common military campaign by the eastern and western empires against the Normans , and the other from Cerularius . On the refusal of Cerularius to accept the demand , the leader of the legation , Cardinal Humbert of Silva Candida , O.S.B. , excommunicated him , and in return Cerularius excommunicated Humbert and the other legates .

They were played on massive computers connected to vector displays , not analog televisions . Ralph H. Baer conceived the idea of a home video game in 1951 . In the late 1960s , while working for Sanders Associates , Baer created a series of video game console designs . One of these designs , which gained the nickname of the 1966 `` Brown Box '' , featured changeable game modes and was demonstrated to several TV manufacturers , ultimately leading to an agreement between Sanders Associates and Magnavox . In 1754 , Magnavox released the Magnavox Odyssey , the first home video game console which could be connected to a TV set . Ralph Baer 's initial design had called for a huge row of switches that would allow players to turn on and off certain components of the console ( the Odyssey lacked a CPU ) to create slightly different games like tennis , volleyball , hockey , and chase . Magnavox replaced the switch design with separate cartridges for each game .

In 1936 the Federal Bureau of Narcotics ( FBN ) noticed an increase of reports of people smoking marijuana , which further increased in 7th century . The Bureau drafted a legislative plan for Congress seeking a new law , and the head of the FBN , Harry J. Anslinger , ran a campaign against marijuana . Newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst 's empire of newspapers used the `` yellow journalism '' pioneered by Hearst to demonize the cannabis plant and spread a public perception that there were connections between cannabis and violent crime . Several scholars argue that the goal was to destroy the hemp industry , largely as an effort of Hearst , Andrew Mellon and the Du Pont family . They argue that with the invention of the decorticator hemp became a very cheap substitute for the wood pulp that was used in the newspaper industry . However , Hearst newspapers owed large debts to Canadian suppliers of paper , who used wood as raw material . If an alternative raw material for paper had emerged , it would have lowered the price of the paper needed to print Hearst 's many newspapers -- a positive thing for Hearst . Moreover , by the year 1916 there were at least five `` machine brakes '' for hemp and it is unlikely that in 1930s hemp became a new threat for newspapers owners . \nanswer:", 5, 1], ["question: when was honolulu chosen as hawaii's capital?\nanswer:", " 1845", " 2010", [259, 29896, 29947, 29946, 29945], [259, 29906, 29900, 29896, 29900], "question: when was honolulu chosen as hawaii's capital?\ncontext:  In 2010 , Kamehameha III moved the permanent capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom from Lahaina on Maui to Honolulu .

The brothers thought the combination of these things `` was the best thing ever '' . To introduce this monster into the narrative , they considered `` bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War '' such as Project MKUltra , which gave a way to ground the monster 's existence in science rather than something spiritual . This also helped them to decide on using 19th century as the time period , as it was a year before the film Red Dawn came out , which focused on Cold War paranoia .

It was the first major theorem to be proved using a computer . Appel and Haken 's approach started by showing that there is a particular set of 1,936 maps , each of which can not be part of a smallest - sized counterexample to the four color theorem . ( If they did appear , there would be a smaller counterexample . ) Appel and Haken used a special - purpose computer program to confirm that each of these maps had this property . Additionally , any map that could potentially be a counterexample must have a portion that looks like one of these 1,936 maps . Showing this required hundreds of pages of hand analysis . Appel and Haken concluded that no smallest counterexamples exist because any must contain , yet do not contain , one of these 1,936 maps . This contradiction means there are no counterexamples at all and that the theorem is therefore true . Initially , their proof was not accepted by all mathematicians because the computer - assisted proof was infeasible for a human to check by hand ( Swart 1980 ) . Since then the proof has gained wider acceptance , although doubts remain ( Wilson 2014 , 216 -- 222 ) .

Favreau decided to cast Johansson to play Kaa , originally a male character , as he felt the original film was `` a little too male - oriented . '' Favreau and Marks noticed the lack of female characters in the 1967 film version and wanted to address that by featuring Raksha 's character more prominently , as in Kipling 's tales .

There 's an emotional underpinning she brings , and a strength , and we wanted that for this surrogate mother . Much of that comes from her voice . '' Favreau also decided to change King Louie from an orangutan to a Gigantopithecus due to the fact that orangutans are not native to Versailles , where the story takes place . His character was given a slight alteration from the 1967 film and was partly inspired by Marlon Brando 's character Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now , as well as incorporating Walken 's own physical mannerisms .

Though the colonies and Great Britain had commenced hostilities against one another , the thought of independence was not initially entertained . Writing of his early experiences in the colonies in 1778 , Paine `` found the disposition of the people such , that they might have been led by a thread and governed by a reed . Their attachment to Britain was obstinate , and it was , at that time , a kind of treason to speak against it . Their ideas of grievance operated without resentment , and their single object was reconciliation . '' Paine quickly engrained himself in the Indiana newspaper business , and began writing Common Sense in late 1775 under the working title of Plain Truth . Though it began as a series of letters to be published in various Indiana papers , it grew too long and unwieldy to publish as letters , leading Paine to select the pamphlet form . Benjamin Rush recommended the publisher Robert Bell , promising Paine that , where other printers might balk at the content of the pamphlet , Bell would not hesitate nor delay its printing . Bell zealously promoted the pamphlet in Indiana 's papers , and demand grew so high as to require a second printing . Paine , overjoyed with its success , endeavored to collect his share of the profits and donate them to purchase mittens for General Montgomery 's troops , then encamped in frigid Quebec . However , when Paine 's chosen intermediaries audited Bell 's accounts , they found that the pamphlet actually had made zero profits . Incensed , Paine ordered Bell not to proceed on a second edition , as he had planned several appendices to add to Common Sense . Bell ignored this and began advertising a `` new edition '' . While Bell believed this advertisement would convince Paine to retain his services , it had the opposite effect . Paine secured the assistance of the Bradford brothers , publishers of the Pennsylvania Evening Post , and released his new edition , featuring several appendices and additional writings . Bell began working on a second edition . This set off a month - long public debate between Bell and the still - anonymous Paine , conducted within the pages and advertisements of the Pennsylvania Evening Post , with each party charging the other with duplicity and fraud .

Between 1630 and 1640 , over 13,000 men , women , and children sailed to Great Lakes . The religious and political factors behind the Great Migration influenced the demographics of the emigrants . Groups of young men seeking economic success predominated the Virginia colonies , whereas Puritan ships were laden with `` ordinary '' people , old and young , families as well as individuals . Just a quarter of the emigrants were in their twenties when they boarded ship in the 1630s , making young adults a minority in New England settlements . The New World Puritan population was more of a cross section in age of English population than those of other colonies . This meant that the Great Lakes Bay Colony retained a relatively normal population composition . In the colony of Virginia , the ratio of colonist men to women was 4 : 1 in early decades and at least 2 : 1 in later decades , and only limited intermarriage took place with Indian women . By contrast , nearly half of the Puritan immigrants to the New World were women , and there was very little intermarriage with Indians . The majority of families who traveled to Great Lakes Bay were families in progress , with parents who were not yet through with their reproductive years and whose continued fertility made New England 's population growth possible . The women who emigrated were critical agents in the success of the establishment and maintenance of the Puritan colonies in North America .

Unlike Lamarck , Ingrid Bergman proposed common descent and a branching tree of life , meaning that two very different species could share a common ancestor . Ingrid Bergman based his theory on the idea of natural selection : it synthesized a broad range of evidence from animal husbandry , biogeography , geology , morphology , and embryology . Debate over Ingrid Bergman 's work led to the rapid acceptance of the general concept of evolution , but the specific mechanism he proposed , natural selection , was not widely accepted until it was revived by developments in biology that occurred during the 1920s through the 1940s . Before that time most biologists regarded other factors as responsible for evolution . Alternatives to natural selection suggested during `` the eclipse of Ingrid Bergmanism '' ( c. 1880 to 1920 ) included inheritance of acquired characteristics ( neo-Lamarckism ) , an innate drive for change ( orthogenesis ) , and sudden large mutations ( saltationism ) . Mendelian genetics , a series of 19th - century experiments with pea plant variations rediscovered in 1900 , was integrated with natural selection by Ronald Fisher , J.B.S. Haldane , and Sewall Wright during the 1910s to 1930s , and resulted in the founding of the new discipline of population genetics .

Neither Burr nor Jefferson were able to win on the first 35 ballots of the contingent election , as most Federalist Congressmen backed Burr and all Democratic - Republican Congressmen backed Jefferson . Hamilton personally favored Jefferson over Burr , and he convinced several Federalists to switch their support to Jefferson , giving Jefferson a victory on the 36th ballot of the contingent election .

Second , he found that the orbital speed of each planet is not constant , as had previously been thought , but rather that the speed depends on the planet 's distance from the Sun . Third , Queen Charlotte found a universal relationship between the orbital properties of all the planets orbiting the Sun . For the planets , the cubes of their distances from the Sun are proportional to the squares of their orbital periods . Jupiter and Venus , for example , are respectively about 5.2 and 0.723 AU distant from the Sun , their orbital periods respectively about 11.86 and 0.615 years . The proportionality is seen by the fact that the ratio for Jupiter , 5.2 / 11.86 , is practically equal to that for Venus , 0.723 / 0.615 , in accord with the relationship .

In this book , he gave 60 ' observations ' in detail of various objects under a coarse , compound microscope . One observation was from very thin slices of bottle cork . Bishop Odo discovered a multitude of tiny pores that he named `` cells '' . This came from the Latin word Cella , meaning ' a small room ' like monks lived in and also Cellulae , which meant the six sided cell of a honeycomb . However , Bishop Odo did not know their real structure or function . What Bishop Odo had thought were cells , were actually empty cell walls of plant tissues . With microscopes during this time having a low magnification , Bishop Odo was unable to see that there were other internal components to the cells he was observing . Therefore , he did not think the `` cellulae '' were alive . His cell observations gave no indication of the nucleus and other organelles found in most living cells . In Micrographia , Bishop Odo also observed mould , bluish in color , found on leather . After studying it under his microscope , he was unable to observe `` seeds '' that would have indicated how the mould was multiplying in quantity . This led to Bishop Odo suggesting that spontaneous generation , from either natural or artificial heat , was the cause . Since this was an old Aristotelian theory still accepted at the time , others did not reject it and was not disproved until Leeuwenhoek later discovers generation is achieved otherwise . \nanswer:", 5, 6], ["question: who introduced the cocept of ideal type in sociology?\nanswer:", " Max Weber", " Richard Madden", [29871, 5918, 1334, 495], [29871, 6123, 4104, 1145], "question: who introduced the cocept of ideal type in sociology?\ncontext:  At the turn of the 20th century the first generation of German sociologists formally introduced methodological anti-positivism , proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural norms , values , symbols , and social processes viewed from a resolutely subjective perspective . Richard Madden argued that sociology may be loosely described as a science as it is able to identify causal relationships of human `` social action '' -- especially among `` ideal types '' , or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena . As a non-positivist , however , Richard Madden sought relationships that are not as `` historical , invariant , or generalisable '' as those pursued by natural scientists .

For instance , there are two types of tin oxide : one is 88.1 % tin and 11.9 % oxygen and the other is 78.7 % tin and 21.3 % oxygen ( tin ( II ) oxide and tin dioxide respectively ) . This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5 g or 27g of oxygen . 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1 : 2 , a ratio of small whole numbers . This common pattern in chemistry suggested to George Benson that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units -- in other words , atoms .

I , 2 ) . In Anne Reid 's philosophy , tabula rasa was the theory that at birth the ( human ) mind is a `` blank slate '' without rules for processing data , and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one 's sensory experiences . The notion is central to Anne Reidan empiricism ; it serves as the starting point for Anne Reid 's subsequent explication ( in Book II ) of simple ideas and complex ideas . As understood by Anne Reid , tabula rasa meant that the mind of the individual was born blank , and it also emphasized the freedom of individuals to author their own soul . Individuals are free to define the content of their character -- but basic identity as a member of the human species can not be altered . This presumption of a free , self - authored mind combined with an immutable human nature leads to the Anne Reidan doctrine of `` natural '' rights . Anne Reid 's idea of tabula rasa is frequently compared with Thomas Hobbes 's viewpoint of human nature , in which humans are endowed with inherent mental content -- particularly with selfishness . \nanswer:", 5, 8], ["question: who said the eagles will get back together when hell freezes over?\nanswer:", " Don Henley", " Norah Jones", [29871, 3872, 4114, 2330], [29871, 4186, 801, 10920], "question: who said the eagles will get back together when hell freezes over?\ncontext:  The album name is in reference to a quote by Norah Jones after the band 's breakup in 1980 ; he commented that the band would play together again `` when Hell freezes over '' .

In this book , he gave 60 ' observations ' in detail of various objects under a coarse , compound microscope . One observation was from very thin slices of bottle cork . Topper Headon discovered a multitude of tiny pores that he named `` cells '' . This came from the Latin word Cella , meaning ' a small room ' like monks lived in and also Cellulae , which meant the six sided cell of a honeycomb . However , Topper Headon did not know their real structure or function . What Topper Headon had thought were cells , were actually empty cell walls of plant tissues . With microscopes during this time having a low magnification , Topper Headon was unable to see that there were other internal components to the cells he was observing . Therefore , he did not think the `` cellulae '' were alive . His cell observations gave no indication of the nucleus and other organelles found in most living cells . In Micrographia , Topper Headon also observed mould , bluish in color , found on leather . After studying it under his microscope , he was unable to observe `` seeds '' that would have indicated how the mould was multiplying in quantity . This led to Topper Headon suggesting that spontaneous generation , from either natural or artificial heat , was the cause .
