The Nackawic consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the Nackawic is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the Nackawic is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the Nackawic with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the Nackawic .

A Sankrit derivation of mayura is from the root mi for kill and said to mean `` killer of snakes '' . Many Hindu deities are associated with the bird , Krishna is often depicted with a feather in his headband , while worshippers of Shiva associate the bird as the steed of the God of war , Kartikeya ( also known as Skanda or Murugan ) . A story in the Uttara Ramayana describes the head of the Devas , Indra , who unable to defeat Ravana , sheltered under the wing of peacock and later blessed it with a `` thousand eyes '' and fearlessness from serpents . Another story has Indra who after being cursed with a thousand ulcers was transformed into a peacock with a thousand eyes . In Buddhist philosophy , the peacock represents wisdom . Peacock feathers are used in many rituals and ornamentation . Peacock motifs are widespread in Indian temple architecture , old coinage , textiles and continue to be used in many modern items of art and utility .

The stories vary and include the idea that the peacock looks at its ugly feet and cries whereupon the tears are fed on by the peahen causing it to be orally impregnated while other variants incorporate sperm transfer from beak to beak . Similar ideas have also been ascribed to Indian crow species . In Greek mythology the origin of the peacocks plumage is explained in the tale of Hera and Argus .

In September 7 , Magnavox released the Magnavox Odyssey , the first home video game console which could be connected to a TV set . Ralph Baer 's initial design had called for a huge row of switches that would allow players to turn on and off certain components of the console ( the Odyssey lacked a CPU ) to create slightly different games like tennis , volleyball , hockey , and chase . Magnavox replaced the switch design with separate cartridges for each game .

The theory of reasoned action was in turn grounded in various theories of attitude such as learning theories , expectancy - value theories , consistency theories ( such as Heider 's balance theory , Osgood and Tannenbaum 's congruity theory , and Festinger 's dissonance theory ) and attribution theory . According to the theory of reasoned action , if people evaluate the suggested behavior as positive ( attitude ) , and if they think their significant others want them to perform the behavior ( subjective norm ) , this results in a higher intention ( motivations ) and they are more likely to do so .

Aston had been appointed to the FIFA Referees ' Committee and was responsible for all referees at the 1966 FIFA World Cup . In the quarter finals , England met Argentina at Wembley Stadium . After the match , newspaper reports stated that referee Rudolf Kreitlein had cautioned both Bobby and Jack Charlton , as well as sending off Argentinian Antonio Rattin . The referee had not made his decision clear during the game , and England manager Alf Ramsey approached FIFA for post-match clarification . This incident started Aston thinking about ways to make a referee 's decisions clearer to both players and spectators . Aston realised that a colour - coding scheme based on the same principle as used on traffic lights ( yellow -- stop if safe to do so , red -- stop ) would transcend language barriers and make it clear that a player had been cautioned or expelled . As a result , yellow cards to indicate a caution and red cards to indicate an expulsion were used for the first time in the November 17 FIFA World Cup in Mexico . The use of penalty cards has since been adopted and expanded by several sporting codes , with each sport adapting the idea to its specific set of rules or laws . \nanswer:", 4, -108], ["question: when was the \u00a320 note last changed?\nanswer:", " 2007", " tenth season", [259, 29906, 29900, 29900, 29955], [29871, 260, 9097, 4259], "question: when was the \u00a320 note last changed?\ncontext:  The current \u00a3 20 note was introduced in tenth season .

The gecko first appeared in 1999 , during the Screen Actors Guild strike that prevented the use of live actors . The original commercial features the Gecko , voiced by actor Kelsey Grammer , who climbs onto a microphone on a podium and utters `` This is my final plea : I am a gecko , not to be confused with GEICO , which could save you hundreds on car insurance . So , STOP CALLING ME ! '' , before licking his eye . Later `` wrong number '' ads used Dave Kelly as the voice of the gecko . In the subsequent commercials with Clayton Moore ( which portray him as a representative of the company ) , the gecko speaks with a British Cockney accent , because it would be unexpected , according to Martin Agency 's Steve Bassett . In 2010s commercials , the gecko 's accent is more working - class , perhaps in an effort to further `` humanize '' him . `` As computer animation got better and as we got to know the character better , we did a few things , '' says Steve Bassett , creative director at The Martin Agency . `` We wanted to make him a little more guy - next - door .

She is an assertive woman who frequently becomes apprehensive over things that often have nothing to do with the current subject matter ( such as Tonya becoming pregnant or her kids selling drugs ) . She is noted for the saucy comebacks that she uses to put a stop to any complaints that her children might have . She uses the comebacks to ensure that they do not end up performing a crime or great misdeed of some sort ; she also fears that they may wind up as street criminals . The narrator describes her as a `` Ghetto Snob '' , likely because of her cautious behavior towards the way her family is perceived in public . She shares loving moments with her children , showing that her true intentions for her assertive ways are sincerely because she cares for them . She also has a passion for chocolate Turtles , which often calm her , and experiences symptoms of withdrawal whenever she must sacrifice them for whatever reason . She is also noted for having to get jobs , and then quitting her job whenever she has a problem with it . Rochelle 's famous catchphrase that refers to this running gag is : `` I do n't need this , my man has two jobs ! '' This expresses her using Julius ' having two jobs as an excuse to quit her job and be comfortable at home . She is very judgemental towards Julius when it comes to their marriage . This can be seen in the episodes where she starts to think that Julius will leave her for a white woman or finds something which leads her to believe that Julius is having an affair . She sometimes disagrees to Julius ' methods about being cheap , like when they celebrated Kwanza instead of Christmas . Julius believes that this method is an effective way to save money for more important things rather than materialistic items . There are times where Rochelle understands Julius ' behavior , like in the episode where he got a second job in order to earn more money for the family . However , Rochelle eventually developed second thoughts about the situation , for she believed that Julius was actually throwing money away . In the final season of the series , Rochelle works as a beautician at Nessa 's Beauty Salon , where in previous seasons she would often get her hair done . She also shared gossip with her friend and owner of the salon , Vanessa ( Jackee Harry ) and other workers of the salon . Another running gag about her is that she regularly threatens her children with physical violence but does not hit them . It is only when she takes them into a room saying `` we need to talk '' when she smacks them . \nanswer:", 5, -17], ["question: who plays the moon on the mighty boosh?\nanswer:", " Noel Fielding", " Muhammad Shah", [29871, 1939, 295, 8989, 292], [29871, 29610, 25897], "question: who plays the moon on the mighty boosh?\ncontext:  The Moon is portrayed by Muhammad Shah with his face covered in shaving foam .

She had died in 1958 , and during her lifetime the DNA structure was not considered as fully proven . It took Wilkins and his colleagues about seven years to collect enough data to prove and refine the proposed DNA structure . Moreover , its biological significance , as proposed by Watson and Emile , was not established . General acceptance for the DNA double helix and its function did not start until late in the 1950s , leading to Nobel nominations in 1960 , 1961 , and 1962 for Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , and in 1962 for Nobel Prize in Chemistry . The first breakthrough was from Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl in 1958 , who experimentally showed the DNA replication of a bacterium Escherichia coli . Now known as Meselson -- Stahl experiment , DNA was found to replicate into two double - stranded helices , with each helix having one of the original DNA strands . This DNA replication was firmly established by 1961 after further demonstration in other species , and of the stepwise chemical reaction .
